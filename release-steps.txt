Release steps.
Just in case I don't do a release for a while and forget what to do... =)

1. Make sure all tests pass

   Run all tests (requires python):

     make check
     or
     cd tests && ./run_tests.py

2. Make sure it builds for Windows via mingw

    sh make_win32.sh

3. Update the version number and rebuild.
Replace the old version with the new version everywhere except in ChangeLog.
Specific files to update:
    configure.in
    documentation/htdocs/index.html
    man/uncrustify.1 (man file)
    src/uncrustify_version.h

Run "sh autogen.sh" and then "./configure".
Rebuild from scratch (make clean && make)

4. Update the config files
$ scripts/update-defaults.sh

5. Update the man file, if any command-line options have changed.

6. Update the ChangeLog to indicate the release date

7. Make sure there are no modified files in the workspace.
   Check in all the changes you just made.

8. Create a dist tarball and win32 package

$ make dist
Untar the file in a temporary folder and run './configure && make && make check'
Then, in that new folder, run 'sh make_win32.sh'.

NOTE: "make distcheck" doesn't work.  It can't find the config.h file.
No idea why.

9. Create a GIT tag
$ git tag -a uncrustify-0.56 -m uncrustify-0.56

10. Re-run 'make dist' and copy out the release tarball.

11. Update and build for windows via mingw (save the zip file this time)

    sh make_win32.sh

12. Update the web page files
$ cd uncrustify-$UNC_REL/
$ scp -r documentation/htdocs/* ChangeLog USER,uncrustify@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/

13. Use the web interface (file manager) to create the release folder and
upload the files to sourceforge.

14. (optional) Create a news item

15. (optional) Update freshmeat.net project
