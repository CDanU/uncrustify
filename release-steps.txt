Release steps.
Just in case I don't do a release for a while and forget what to do... =)

NOTE: this is mostly obsolete, as Uncrustify now uses git

0. Update the following two lines and paste into a terminal:

UNC_URL=https://uncrustify.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/uncrustify
UNC_REL=0.55

1. Make sure all tests pass

   Run all tests (requires python):

     cd tests
     ./run_tests.py

2. Make sure it builds on Windows

3. Update the version number.
Replace the old version with the new version everywhere except in ChangeLog.
Specific files to update:
    configure.in
    documentation/htdocs/index.html
    man/uncrustify.1 (man file)
    src/uncrustify_version.h
Run "sh autogen.sh" and then "./configure".

3a. Rebuild from scratch (make clean && make)

4. Update the config files
$ scripts/update-defaults.sh

4a. Update the man file, if any command-line options have changed.

5. Update the ChangeLog to indicate the release date

6. Make sure there are no modified files in the workspace.
   Check in all the changes you just made.

7. Copy the trunk to a tag
$ svn cp $UNC_URL/trunk/uncrustify $UNC_URL/tags/uncrustify-$UNC_REL -m "uncrustify-$UNC_REL"

8. Export to the release folder
$ cd ../releases
$ svn export $UNC_URL/tags/uncrustify-$UNC_REL

9. Tar up the files
$ tar czf uncrustify-$UNC_REL.tgz uncrustify-$UNC_REL

REVISIT: consider splitting the tests out from the source

10. Update and build on windows
Copy the exe, ChangeLog, index.html, and all the .cfg files in etc into a
folder named "uncrustify-$UNC_REL-win32".
Zip up that folder using the folder name + ".zip"
Copy to the release folder on Linux

11. Copy the files to sourceforge
$ sftp USER,uncrustify@frs.sourceforge.net
sftp> cd /home/pfs/project/u/un/uncrustify/uncrustify/uncrustify-0.XX
sftp> put uncrustify-0.XX.tgz
sftp> put uncrustify-0.XX-win32.tgz
sftp> exit

12. Update the web page files
$ cd uncrustify-$UNC_REL/documentation/htdocs
$ scp -r * USER,uncrustify@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/

13. Use the web interface to create the release and attach the files

14. (optional) Create a news item

15. (optional) Update freshmeat.net project
