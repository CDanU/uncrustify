Release steps.
Just in case I don't do a release for a while and forget what to do... =)

1. Make sure all tests pass

   Run all tests (requires python):

     make check
     or
     cd tests && ./run_tests.py

2. Make sure it builds on Windows

3. Update the version number and rebuild.
Replace the old version with the new version everywhere except in ChangeLog.
Specific files to update:
    configure.in
    documentation/htdocs/index.html
    man/uncrustify.1 (man file)
    src/uncrustify_version.h

Run "sh autogen.sh" and then "./configure".
Rebuild from scratch (make clean && make)

4. Update the config files
$ scripts/update-defaults.sh

5. Update the man file, if any command-line options have changed.

6. Update the ChangeLog to indicate the release date

7. Make sure there are no modified files in the workspace.
   Check in all the changes you just made.

8. Create a dist tarball and make sure it works
$ make dist
Untar the file in a temporary folder and run './configure && make && make check'

NOTE: "make distcheck" doesn't work.  It can't find the config.h file.
No idea why.

9. Create a GIT tag
$ git tag -a v0.55

10. Re-run 'make dist' and copy out the release tarball.

11. Update and build on windows
Copy the exe, ChangeLog, index.html, and all the .cfg files in etc into a
folder named "uncrustify-$UNC_REL-win32".
Zip up that folder using the folder name + ".zip"
Copy to the release folder on Linux

12. Copy the files to sourceforge
$ sftp USER,uncrustify@frs.sourceforge.net
sftp> cd /home/pfs/project/u/un/uncrustify/uncrustify/uncrustify-0.XX
sftp> put uncrustify-0.XX.tgz
sftp> put uncrustify-0.XX-win32.tgz
sftp> exit

12. Update the web page files
$ cd uncrustify-$UNC_REL/documentation/htdocs
$ scp -r documentation/htdocs/* ChangeLog USER,uncrustify@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/

13. Use the web interface to create the release and attach the files

14. (optional) Create a news item

15. (optional) Update freshmeat.net project
